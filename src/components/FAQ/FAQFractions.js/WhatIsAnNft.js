                <h2 className='font-bold text-2xl my-2'>What Are NFTs?</h2>
                <p className='text-[15px] '>
                    In the rapidly evolving landscape of the digital age, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a groundbreaking technology, revolutionizing the way we perceive, buy, and sell digital assets. NFTs represent ownership or proof of authenticity of unique items using blockchain technology.

                <h3 className='font-bold text-xl my-2 ml-3'>Breaking Down the Term:</h3>

                    1. <span className='font-bold'>
                        Non-Fungible
                    </span>:Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are unique and indivisible.
                </p>
                <p className='text-[15px] ml-3 pt-2'>

                        Tokens
                    </span>:
                    NFTs are represented as tokens on a blockchain, most commonly the Ethereum blockchain. Each token contains metadata that provides information about the asset it represents.

                    How NFTs Work:
                </h2>

                <h3 className='font-bold text-xl my-2 ml-3'>
                    Blockchain and Smart Contracts:
                </h3>
                <p className='text-[15px] ml-3'>
                    NFTs are built on blockchain technology, a decentralized and distributed ledger. This ensures transparency, security, and immutability. Smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into code, facilitate the creation and transfer of NFTs.
                </p>
                <h3 className='font-bold text-xl my-2 ml-3'>Ownership and Scarcity:</h3>
                <p className='text-[15px] ml-3'>
                    NFTs derive their value from the concept of digital ownership. When an artist or creator mints an NFT, they embed information about the asset into a token, making it unique. This uniqueness and scarcity contribute to the perceived value of the digital item.
                </p>
